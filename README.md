## Usage

To set up a database and populate it, run the command "node utils/seed.js" from the project's root folder. Next, start the application by running the command "node server.js" from the same directory to begin listening for requests. After the server enters listening mode, test all routes using Insomnia. To see this process in action, refer to the following walkthrough video.
